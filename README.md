# Python Chatbot

<h2>Description</h2>
Python scripts containing a natural language processing chatbot. Implemented using neural networks with tensorflow. The responses are hard-coded.
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
The training program needs to be run before the chatbot program. The training program sets up the intents, and saves the training data in the .h5 file, which the chatbot program uses.
